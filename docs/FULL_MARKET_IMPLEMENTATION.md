```

### Option 3: Scheduled Daily Execution (6:30 AM EST)

Set up cron job:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line:
```cron
30 6 * * 1-5 /path/to/stock-screener/daily_scanner.sh
```

See `SETUP_CRON_JOB.md` for detailed instructions.

## ⚙️ Performance Tuning

### To Speed Up (Process Fewer Stocks)

```bash
# Higher quality stocks only
python run_full_market_scan.py --min-price 10 --min-volume 500000
```

This reduces universe to ~2,000 stocks → ~35 minutes runtime

### To Process More Stocks (Riskier)

```bash
# Include lower priced stocks
python run_full_market_scan.py --min-price 1
```

This increases to ~5,000 stocks → ~1.5 hours runtime

### WARNING: Don't Speed Up Rate Limit

```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - May trigger API ban
python run_full_market_scan.py --rate-limit 0.5  # 2 TPS
```

Stick with 1.0 seconds (1 TPS) for reliability.

- [ ] Run test mode: `python run_full_market_scan.py --test-mode`
- [ ] Verify test output in `./data/daily_scans/`
- [ ] Check test logs in `./data/logs/`
- [ ] Test resume: Interrupt with Ctrl+C, then `--resume`
- [ ] Test clear: `python run_full_market_scan.py --clear-progress`
- [ ] Run manual full scan (if time permits)
- [ ] Verify cron script: `./daily_scanner.sh`
- [ ] Set up cron job (see SETUP_CRON_JOB.md)
