## Overview

**Intelligent Stock Screener** is a fully automated, data-driven stock screening and position management system that scans 3,800+ US stocks daily to identify high-conviction buy and sell signals based on:

- **Phase-based trend classification** (4-stage market cycle analysis)
- **Relative strength momentum** (smooth linear scoring vs SPY)
- **Fundamental quality filters** (growth, profitability, financial health)
- **Volume-weighted breakout detection**
- **Risk-managed stop loss recommendations**

This system was built to eliminate emotional decision-making and provide objective, repeatable trade signals backed by technical and fundamental analysis.

### What This System Does

1. **Screens 3,800+ stocks every market day** using GitHub Actions automation
2. **Identifies buy signals** for stocks in confirmed Phase 2 uptrends that pass Minervini's 8-criteria Trend Template
3. **Identifies sell signals** when stocks enter Phase 3 (distribution) or Phase 4 (downtrend) with weakening momentum
4. **Calculates precise stop losses** with risk/reward ratios for every buy signal (max 10% risk, min 2:1 R:R)
5. **Generates daily reports** with ranked opportunities and full technical analysis
6. **Manages existing positions** with automated stop-loss trailing recommendations

### Why I Built It This Way

**Problem:** Most stock screeners rely on static fundamental metrics (P/E, P/B) or generic technical patterns that don't adapt to market conditions. They ignore:
- **Market regime** (is SPY in an uptrend or downtrend?)
- **Relative strength** (is the stock outperforming the market?)
- **Phase transitions** (is the stock breaking out or breaking down?)
- **Smart caching** (redundant API calls wasting time and hitting rate limits)

**Solution:** This system implements Mark Minervini's **Trend Template methodology** where:
- Only buy **confirmed Phase 2 uptrends** (not early Phase 1 bases)
- Must pass **7 of 8 strict technical criteria** (50>150>200 SMA, price near highs, etc.)
- **Timing matters** - only buy when market (SPY) is also healthy
- **Relative strength matters** - only buy stocks outperforming the market
- **Cache-first design** - 74% reduction in API calls through Git-based fundamental storage

## Methodology & Attribution

This system implements **Mark Minervini's Trend Template** (also known as SEPA - Specific Entry Point Analysis), a systematic approach to identifying high-probability stock setups in confirmed Stage 2 uptrends.

### Mark Minervini's Influence

The core buy signal methodology is based on principles from:

- **"Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard"** (2013) - Minervini's systematic approach to stock selection using the Trend Template
- **"Think & Trade Like a Champion"** (2017) - Advanced stage analysis and risk management techniques
- **"Momentum Masters"** (2015) - Multi-contributor insights on momentum trading strategies

### The Minervini Trend Template (8 Criteria)

Buy signals **only** trigger when stocks pass **7 of 8 strict criteria**:

1. ✅ **Price > 150 SMA AND 200 SMA** - Stock must be in established uptrend
2. ✅ **150 SMA > 200 SMA** - Moving averages in bullish alignment
3. ✅ **200 SMA trending up ≥1 month** - Long-term trend is bullish
4. ✅ **50 SMA > 150 SMA > 200 SMA** - Strongest SMA configuration (cascading)
5. ✅ **Price > 50 SMA** - Stock respecting short-term support
6. ✅ **Price ≥30% above 52-week low** - Stock has built significant base
7. ✅ **Price within 25% of 52-week high** - Near new highs (not extended)
8. ✅ **Relative Strength ≥70** - Outperforming market (we use RS slope ≥ +0.15)

**Why This Works:**
- Identifies stocks in **confirmed uptrends** (not early bases)
- Filters out weak stocks with poor price structure
- Ensures proper risk/reward (stocks near highs with strong momentum)
- Aligns with institutional buying (big money follows strong trends)

### Additional Influences

While the core entry criteria follow Minervini's template, this system also incorporates concepts from:

- **Stan Weinstein** - 4-stage market cycle analysis ("Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets")
- **William O'Neil** - Fundamental screening criteria (CANSLIM methodology)
- **IBD Methodology** - Relative strength ranking and market regime awareness

### Our Implementation

We've automated Minervini's manual screening process with additional enhancements:

- **Smooth linear scoring** instead of binary pass/fail (reduces false signals)
- **Market regime filtering** (SPY phase + breadth checks - only buy in healthy markets)
- **Automated fundamental screening** (growth, profitability, financial health)
- **Precise stop-loss calculation** (ATR-based + swing lows, max 10% risk)
- **R:R validation** (only include signals with ≥2:1 reward/risk ratio)

The system stays true to Minervini's core principle: **Buy confirmed Stage 2 breakouts with strong fundamentals and clear risk management.**

### Data Flow

1. **Daily Scan** (GitHub Actions, 1 PM UTC M-F):
   - Fetches universe of 3,800+ US stocks from NASDAQ/NYSE
   - Downloads 1 year price history for each (250 trading days)
   - Fetches fundamentals using earnings-aware cache refresh strategy
   - Stores in Git-based cache (persists beyond Actions cache limits)

2. **Signal Generation**:
   - Classifies SPY phase to determine market regime
   - Calculates market breadth (% stocks in each phase)
   - For each stock: classifies phase, calculates RS, analyzes fundamentals
   - Scores buy/sell signals using weighted formula
   - Ranks results and generates formatted report

3. **Position Management** (Manual):
   - Fetches current positions from Robinhood (read-only)
   - Loads cached price/fundamental data (zero extra API calls)
   - Analyzes each position's phase, SMA levels, momentum
   - Recommends stop loss adjustments using linear scaling formulas
   - Outputs actionable report with exact price targets

## Key Features

### ✅ **Phase-Based Trend Classification**

Stocks are classified into 4 phases based on moving average slopes and price position:

- **Phase 1 (Base Building)**: Consolidation after decline. 50/200 SMA flattening, price finding support. **NOT YET READY**
- **Phase 2 (Uptrend)**: Confirmed uptrend. 50>150>200 SMA (all rising), price above all SMAs. **BUY ZONE** ⭐
- **Phase 3 (Distribution)**: Topping pattern. SMAs starting to flatten/cross, momentum weakening. **SELL ZONE**
- **Phase 4 (Downtrend)**: Declining trend. 50 SMA < 200 SMA, both falling, price below both. **AVOID**

**Important**: Following Minervini's methodology, buy signals **only** trigger for **Phase 2 stocks** that pass the Trend Template. Phase 1 stocks are still basing and not ready for entry.

### 📈 **Relative Strength Momentum**

- Smooth linear scoring (0-10 scale) vs SPY benchmark
- 63-day RS slope calculation (captures 3-month momentum trend)
- Penalizes underperformance, rewards outperformance
- Crucial filter: only buy stocks beating the market

### 💰 **Fundamental Quality Screening**

- **Growth**: Revenue growth, EPS growth trends
- **Profitability**: Operating margins, ROE
- **Financial Health**: Debt ratios, current ratio
- Only applied to Phase 1/2 stocks (Phase 3/4 skip fundamentals - price action is king)

### 🎯 **Risk-Managed Stop Losses**

Every buy signal includes:
- **Entry price**: Current market price or breakout level
- **Stop loss**: ATR-based or swing low-based
- **Risk amount**: $ per share risked
- **Reward target**: 2-3x risk minimum
- **R:R ratio**: Always ≥ 2:1 for inclusion

### 🔄 **Smart Caching Strategy**

- **Price data**: Always fetch fresh (needed for current signals)
- **Fundamentals**: Git-based storage with earnings-aware refresh
  - Earnings season (6-week windows): Refresh if >7 days old
  - Normal periods: Refresh if >90 days old
  - Result: **74% reduction in API calls**, zero GitHub Actions cache expiry issues

### 🤖 **Full Automation**

- Runs daily via GitHub Actions (1 PM UTC, weekdays only)
- No manual intervention required
- Results committed to repository (full history)
- Adaptable to market conditions (skips buy signals in weak markets)

---

## Design Philosophy

### 1. **Cache-First, API-Second**

**Rationale:** yfinance has strict rate limits (~2 req/sec). Scanning 3,800 stocks requires 3,800+ API calls. At 1 TPS, that's 63 minutes. But fundamentals change slowly (quarterly earnings), so why re-fetch every day?

**Solution:**
- Store fundamentals in Git repository as JSON files
- Add metadata with `fetched_at` timestamp
- During scan: Check if cache exists and is fresh
- Only fetch if stale or missing
- Result: 1,762 cached stocks = **74% fewer API calls** = **15-20 min faster scans**

### 2. **Confirmed Uptrends Only (Minervini's Stage 2)**

**Rationale:** Traditional screeners look for "cheap" stocks (low P/E) or early bases (Phase 1). But cheap stocks can get cheaper, and bases can fail. Minervini only buys **confirmed Stage 2 uptrends**.

**Solution:**
- Classify stocks into 4 phases based on SMA slopes and price position
- **Only buy Phase 2** (confirmed uptrends with 50>150>200 SMA alignment)
- Reject Phase 1 (still basing, not confirmed)
- Only sell Phase 2 → 3/4 transitions (breakdowns from tops)
- This filters out 70%+ of stocks immediately, leaving only the highest-quality setups

### 3. **Relative Strength as Primary Filter**

**Rationale:** Absolute returns don't matter - **relative returns** do. A stock up 5% when SPY is up 10% is actually underperforming. Market leaders (high RS) tend to continue leading.

**Solution:**
- Calculate 63-day RS slope (3-month trend)
- Smooth linear scoring (not bucket-based)
- 10 points max for RS in buy signal scoring
- Filters out weak stocks even if other metrics look good

### 4. **Linear Formulas Over Buckets**

**Rationale:** Bucket-based scoring (e.g., "P/E < 15 = 10 points, P/E 15-20 = 5 points") creates artificial cliffs. A stock with P/E 14.9 and P/E 15.1 shouldn't have a 5-point difference.

**Solution:**
- All scoring uses **linear interpolation**
- Example: RS slope scoring scales smoothly from -0.3 (0 points) to +0.3 (10 points)
- Stop loss trailing scales linearly with gain % (5% gain → lock 1% profit, 40% gain → lock 18% profit)
- Result: Smoother, more reasonable scoring

### 5. **Market Regime Awareness**

**Rationale:** Buy signals in a bear market (SPY in Phase 4) have low win rates. Why generate signals that are likely to fail?

**Solution:**
- Classify SPY phase before generating signals
- Calculate market breadth (% stocks in Phase 2)
- Only generate buy signals if:
  - SPY in Phase 1 or 2 (market not declining)
  - AND ≥15% of stocks in Phase 2 (sufficient breadth)
- Sell signals always generated (can exit in any market)

### 6. **Read-Only Position Management**

**Rationale:** Executing trades programmatically is risky and requires extensive safeguards. But **analyzing positions** and **recommending adjustments** can be automated safely.

**Solution:**
- Robinhood integration is **read-only** (only fetches positions)
- Never calls trading functions (no `order_buy_*`, `order_sell_*`)
- Position manager recommends stop adjustments
- Human executes trades manually on Robinhood app
- Best of both worlds: automation + human oversight

## Daily Workflow

### Automated Mode (GitHub Actions)

The system runs automatically every weekday at 1 PM UTC (9 AM EST):

1. **Scan triggers** via GitHub Actions schedule
2. **Fetches universe** of 3,800+ US stocks
3. **Downloads price data** for all stocks
4. **Loads cached fundamentals** (or fetches if stale)
5. **Classifies phases** and calculates RS
6. **Generates signals** based on market regime
7. **Saves report** to `data/daily_scans/latest_optimized_scan.txt`
8. **Commits results** to repository

**You receive:**
- Daily email/Slack notification (if configured)
- Ranked buy signals with stop losses
- Ranked sell signals with breakdown levels
- Market regime analysis (SPY phase + breadth)

### Manual Mode (Local)

Run on-demand scans:

```bash
# Conservative scan (2 workers, 1.0s delay = ~2 TPS)
python run_optimized_scan.py --conservative

# Default scan (3 workers, 0.5s delay = ~6 TPS)
python run_optimized_scan.py

# Aggressive scan (5 workers, 0.3s delay = ~17 TPS) - MAY HIT RATE LIMITS
python run_optimized_scan.py --aggressive

# Resume from interruption
python run_optimized_scan.py --resume

# Clear cached progress and start fresh
python run_optimized_scan.py --clear-progress
```

---

## Manual Position Management

**⚠️ Note:** Position management requires manual execution. This is intentional for safety.

### Step 1: Ensure Robinhood Username is Set

In your `.env` file:

```bash
ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
```

**Important:** Password is NEVER stored. You will be prompted interactively.

### Step 2: Run Position Manager

```bash
# Basic analysis (prompts for password + SMS MFA)
python manage_positions.py

# With entry dates for tax-aware recommendations
python manage_positions.py --entry-dates entry_dates.json

# Export report to file
python manage_positions.py --export
```

### Step 3: Interactive Authentication

```
Logging in to Robinhood...
Robinhood password for you@example.com: ********

MFA required - check your phone for SMS code from Robinhood
Enter SMS code from Robinhood: 123456

✓ Robinhood login successful with SMS MFA
```

### Step 4: Review Recommendations

The tool will:
- Fetch your current positions from Robinhood
- Analyze each using **cached market data** (zero extra API calls)
- Calculate phase, SMA levels, recent swing lows
- Recommend stop loss adjustments using linear formulas

### Stop Loss Logic

Recommendations use **linear formulas** (not buckets):

| Gain Range | Recommendation | Stop Level |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| 0-5% | Hold initial stop | Original stop |
| 5-10% | Trail to breakeven | Entry price |
| 10-20% | Trail to profit | Entry × (1 + locked_profit_pct/100) |
| 20-30% | Take 25-30% partial | Remaining at +10% profit |
| 30%+ | Take 50% partial | Remaining at tight trail |

**Locked profit % formula:**
```python
locked_profit_pct = min(gain_pct - 3, gain_pct * 0.5)
```

Examples:
- 5% gain → Lock 2% profit
- 10% gain → Lock 3.5% profit
- 20% gain → Lock 8.5% profit
- 40% gain → Lock 18.5% profit

### Tax-Aware Filtering

**Long-term positions (365+ days held)** are excluded from stop adjustments to preserve favorable capital gains tax treatment (15-20% vs ordinary income rate).

To enable:

1. Create `entry_dates.json`:
```json
{
  "AAPL": "2024-10-18T00:00:00",
  "NVDA": "2024-11-13T00:00:00",
  "MSFT": "2023-05-10T00:00:00"
}
```

2. Run with `--entry-dates`:
```bash
python manage_positions.py --entry-dates entry_dates.json
```

## Technical Details

### Phase Classification Algorithm

```python
def classify_phase(price_data: pd.DataFrame, current_price: float) -> Dict:
    """
    Classifies stock into 4 phases based on SMA slopes and price position.

    Returns:
        {
            'phase': int (1-4),
            'phase_name': str,
            'confidence': float (0-100),
            'sma_50': float,
            'sma_200': float,
            'slope_50': float (annualized),
            'slope_200': float (annualized),
            'reasons': List[str]
        }
    """
```

**Logic:**
1. Calculate 50-day and 200-day SMAs
2. Calculate slopes (annualized % change rate)
3. Classify phase based on:
   - SMA ordering (50 > 200 or 50 < 200)
   - Slope directions (rising, falling, or flat)
   - Price position relative to SMAs
4. Return phase with confidence score

### Relative Strength Calculation

```python
def calculate_relative_strength(
    stock_prices: pd.Series,
    spy_prices: pd.Series,
    period: int = 63
) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Calculates smooth RS using linear regression slope.

    Args:
        stock_prices: Stock close prices
        spy_prices: SPY close prices (benchmark)
        period: Lookback window (63 days = 3 months)

    Returns:
        Series of RS slopes (annualized)
    """
```

**Formula:**
```
RS_ratio = stock_return / spy_return
RS_slope = linear_regression_slope(RS_ratio, period)
RS_score = clip((RS_slope + 0.3) / 0.6 * 10, 0, 10)
```

Interpretation:
- RS slope +0.3 = 10 points (strong outperformance)
- RS slope 0.0 = 5 points (matching market)
- RS slope -0.3 = 0 points (strong underperformance)

### Buy Signal Scoring (110 points max)

| Component | Max Points | Criteria |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Phase** | 30 | Phase 2 = 30, Phase 1 = 20 |
| **RS Momentum** | 10 | Linear scale from RS slope |
| **Volume** | 10 | Breakout on high volume |
| **Proximity to Breakout** | 10 | Close to resistance level |
| **Fundamentals** | 50 | Growth (20) + Profitability (15) + Health (15) |

**Threshold:** Buy signal score ≥ 70 for inclusion in report.

### Sell Signal Scoring (110 points max)

| Component | Max Points | Criteria |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Phase** | 30 | Phase 4 = 30, Phase 3 = 20 |
| **RS Momentum** | 10 | Negative RS (underperformance) |
| **Volume** | 10 | Breakdown on high volume |
| **SMA Breakdown** | 15 | Broke below 50/200 SMA |
| **Price Action** | 15 | Lower highs, lower lows |
| **Severity** | 30 | Combination of above factors |

**Threshold:** Sell signal score ≥ 60 for inclusion in report.

### Stop Loss Calculation

```python
def calculate_stop_loss(
    entry_price: float,
    price_data: pd.DataFrame,
    atr_period: int = 14,
    atr_multiplier: float = 2.0
) -> Dict:
    """
    Calculates stop loss using ATR or swing lows.

    Returns:
        {
            'stop_price': float,
            'risk_amount': float,
            'stop_type': str ('atr' or 'swing_low')
        }
    """
```

**Method 1: ATR-Based**
```
ATR = Average True Range (14 days)
Stop = Entry - (ATR × 2.0)
```

**Method 2: Swing Low-Based**
```
Swing_Low = Lowest low in last 20 days
Stop = Swing_Low × 0.98  (2% buffer)
```

Uses whichever is **higher** (more conservative).

### Risk/Reward Validation

Every buy signal calculates:
```python
risk = entry_price - stop_loss
reward = (entry_price × 1.20) - entry_price  # 20% target
r_r_ratio = reward / risk
```

**Filter:** Only include signals with R:R ≥ 2:1.
